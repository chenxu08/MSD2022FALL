1. Where is the assertEquals method defined? What does it do? Can we use assertEquals for more than just int types? (Hint: Consult the API for JUnit)
In the DiffUtilTest class. It is test for whether the result is correct. If we change the array type, we can use other type.


2. Briefly describe what each of the three tests is checking.
For 1:If the array contains less than two items, returns -1.
For 2:If all Array Elements equal to each other, return 0;
For 3:Finding the correct difference.


3. Why is our unimplemented findSmallestDiff method passing one of the tests?
Because, it always returns 0, so it can pass test 2.

4. Why are we failing the third test? How should our method be modified to correct this?
Because we did not consider the situation that the difference is nagetive. We should use math.abs().

5. What is the appropriate call to assertEquals for your new test (test 4)?
I may set a array which have all negative number to make sure that the abs() is working correctly.

6. Provide one more test (test 5) for the findSmallestDiff method. Briefly describe your test and write the call to assertEquals here.

arr4 = new int[] { -10, -5, 0, 5, 10 };

 assertEquals(0, DiffUtil.findSmallestDiff(arr4));

7. Briefly describe your unit tests for Assignment 1.
The test ensure that this findsmalldiff class is always working correctly.
